Hello, this is the first post of my new blog what I made, for ages my [old site](/old_site) was an ironic (and hilarious) faux terrible 'my first website' affair, complete with proud html 4 strict compliance banner and animated gifs. My friends insisted that this was terrible, completely unprofessional, and that having it on my CV was a mistake and bound to get me put in the discard pile. They're probably right (although I did get two webdev jobs with it) so I've decided to put up this blog.

I'm not entirely sure what I plan to put up here, but over the last few weeks I've had some ideas p (mainly for the amusement of myself and my friends), and I figure it'd be an interesting opportunity to brush up on my writing skills. Here are some of the things you might see if you decide to stick around:

* Short stories I've written in conjunction with my friend Andy J
* Exciting new business ideas!
* Shit musings about my boring life
* Videogame related waffle
* Any interesting tech shit I come across
* Comedy I find amusing

So thanks
