Hello, I'm Jonathan Stahlhacke. I live in Birmingham. I once worked at [Made Media](http://www.congenica.com/), [Congenica](http://www.congenica.com/) and [Future](https://www.futureplc.com/).

I like videogames, programming, alternative comedy and paintball.

I'm on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/popeshoe) and also [GitHub](https://github.com/popeshoe) (sometimes)
